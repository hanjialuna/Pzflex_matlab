Matlab_Toolbox
==============
This Matlab Toolbox has been developed to allow users to create and run PZFlex models directly from Matlab.
This helps users who are experienced in using Matlab to quickly and easily create and run simulations in PZFlex.

The toolbox contains a series of Matlab fuctions for the most commonly used PZFlex commands.
When called in a Matlab script these functions print the correct lines of code to a PZFlex input file or review file.

Please refer to PZFlex Matlab Toolbox Users Guide before use
